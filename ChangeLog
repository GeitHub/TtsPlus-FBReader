* Added Bluetooth headset controls for play/pause/resume and next/previous buttons
* Improved control panel, adding Setup button that opens rate, pitch and volume
  slider controls, and buttons to reset to default values, select language and
  open system TTS settings app, e.g. to change the TTS engine.
* Subdividing paragraphs into sentences. This makes it possible to pause and resume
  playback at sentence resolution, instead of listening again to the part of 
  possibly long paragraph already heard before.
* Also proposed a small change to the main reader app to let it start talking upon
  pressing Bluetooth play button, without going through the menu. Up to gemeter
  to add these changes to the main reader app code.
