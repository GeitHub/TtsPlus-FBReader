To do for ver. 1.0.5 or higher:
------------------------------
Sentence highlighting already works. Maybe remove paragraph speech and
highlight options?
Prev/Next buttons should now work by sentence, not paragraph,
and highlight accordingly.
Add option to stop after each sentence?

Done:
----
Limit display area of main reader so that text is not hidden under speech
buttons.

------------------------------------------------------------------
Checking for null data object in SpeakActivity.onActivityResult()

Removed READ_PHONE_STATE permission and PhoneStateListener() -
OnAudioFocusChangeListener() in SpeadService is enough to break
through the phone calls.

1.0.2 released 5/26/2012
------------------------
Lowered API to 8, Android 2.2
Small code corrections
