TTS+ is a plugin for FBReader on Android, a product of geometerplus.
You can find FBReader in Google Play Store, and the source code to
it as https://github.com/geometer/FBReaderJ. TTS+ Plugin is a free
product, licensed under Apache License 2.0.

The TTS+ plugin works relatively well with FBReader 1.5.x currently
released, but to work really well it would need some changes to
FBReader, which I suggested to the author of the reader. I think
that FBReader should also implement a "content provider service"
to feed text to other plugins. This would prevent the destroying of
objects and FBReader process when it's in background, which gets
plugins using it into trouble.
